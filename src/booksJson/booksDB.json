In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles   the collective intelligence   locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users.    Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches.    This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit.    Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

      "longDescription": "From rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page scripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server, corporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day, somewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP. Even when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a modern web application requires tools that decrease development time and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a result.     For PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise without the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of components can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the development process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend Technologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language in which it is written. The first production release of the Zend Framework became available in July of 2007.    Zend Framework in Action is a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based applications and web services. This book takes you on an over-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as you build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is organized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web developer \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As you follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive Ajax-driven features into your application without sacrificing nuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.  This book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to master framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action goes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most common topics encountered in the development of web applications.  ",

The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage.    Cut to reality.    You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget  Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\"    Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world   not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software.    The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex.    The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR). You will learn how to integrate Flex into your existing applications in order to build a next generation application that will delight users.

Enterprise OSGi addresses several shortcomings of existing enterprise platforms, such as allowing the creation of better maintainable and extensible applications, and provide a simpler, easier-to-use, light-weight solution to enterprise software development.",
      "longDescription": "A good application framework greatly simplifies a developer's task by providing reusable code modules that solve common, tedious, or complex tasks. Writing a great framework requires an extraordinary set of skills-ranging from deep knowledge of a programming language and target platform to a crystal-clear view of the problem space where the applications to be developed using the framework will be used.    OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.    Author Alexandre Alves guides you through major concepts, such as the definition of programming models and modularization techniques, and complements them with samples that have real applicability using industry-proved technologies, such as Spring-DM and Equinox.",

      "shortDescription": "\"Flexible Rails created a standard to which I hold other technical books. You definitely get your money's worth.\"",
      "longDescription": "Rails is a fantastic tool for web application development, but its Ajax-driven interfaces stop short of the richness you gain with a tool like Adobe Flex. Simply put, Flex is the most productive way to build the UI of rich Internet applications, and Rails is the most productive way to rapidly build a database-backed CRUD application. Together, they're an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it's an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.    You will also learn how Flex and Rails integrate with HTTPService and XML, and see how RESTful Rails controller design gracefully supports using the same controller actions for Flex and HTML clients. The author will show you how Cairngorm can be used to architect larger Flex applications, including tips to use Cairngorm in a less verbose way with HTTPService to talk to Rails.    Flexible Rails is for both Rails developers who are interested in Flex, and Flex developers who are interested in Rails. For a Rails developer, Flex allows for more dynamic and engaging user interfaces than are possible with Ajax. For a Flex developer, Rails provides a way to rapidly build the ORM and services layer of the application.",

      "longDescription": "In complex software projects, managing the development process can be as critical to success as writing the code itself. A project may involve dozens of developers, managers, architects, testers, and customers, hundreds of builds, and thousands of opportunities to get off-track. To keep tabs on the people, tasks, and components of a medium- to large-scale project, most teams use a development system that allows for easy monitoring, follow-up, and accountability.    Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 (TFS), the server component of Microsoft's Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), provides a powerful collaborative platform for software-development teams. The product offers an integrated toolset for tracking work items, creating test cases, managing source code, generating builds, constructing database schemas, and so on. Because in software development one size does not fit all, TFS provides process customization, project management, and reporting capabilities to build solutions around your requirements.    Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a hands-on guide to Team Foundation Server 2008. Written for developers with a good handle on TFS basics, this book shows you how to solve real-life problems. It's not a repetition of Microsoft's product documentation. Team Foundation Server 2008 in Action is a practitioner's handbook for how to work with TFS under common constraints. This book walks you through real-life software engineering problems based on hundreds of hours of TFS experience.    You'll benefit from expert author Jamil Azher's extensive interactions with members of Microsoft's TFS team and MVPs, survey feedback from the author's blog, and interviews with organizations and user groups using TFS. Instead of just offering a high-level overview, the book provides detailed solutions for solving common   and not-so-common   problems using TFS. It discusses the strengths as well as weaknesses of TFS, and suggests appropriate problem resolution steps, workarounds, or custom solutions.",

      "longDescription": "It's easy to get excited about building a new software project from scratch. So-called \"greenfield\" projects often involve learning new technology and the opportunity for experimentation. Working on established software projects may seem less glamorous.    Most software developers have inherited a monolithic application where the day-to-day tasks involve maintenance, incremental improvements, or even cleaning up the mess another programmer left behind. These legacy or brownfield projects often have tightly coupled components, low cohesion, and poor separation of concerns, making them fragile and resistant to change.    Brownfield Application Development in .Net shows you how to approach legacy applications with the state-of-the-art concepts, patterns, and tools you've learned to apply to new projects. Using an existing application as an example, this book guides you in applying the techniques and best practices you need to make it more maintainable and receptive to change.    Starting with the build process and the introduction of unit tests, the authors show you how to set up the application so that in later chapters, you can make incremental changes aimed at decoupling components from each other. Each practice introduced will increase your confidence and ability to make subsequent changes to your code.    As the book proceeds, the authors introduce frameworks and tools commonly used today while still approaching the subject from a conceptual level so that you can substitute alternate tools as appropriate. This book examines the reasons why a tool is necessary, not the tool itself. Because the book is based on the authors' experiences, Brownfield Application Development in .Net moves beyond the theories and shows you the techniques you need to be successful.",

Emphasis is on standalone and web-based business applications, such as for online sales and mass customization, but much of what this book offers has broad applicability to 3D user interfaces in other pursuits such as scientific visualization and gaming.  This book provides an extensive conceptual framework for 3D user interface techniques, and an in-depth introduction to user interface support in the Java 3D API, including such topics as picking, collision, and drag-and-drop. Many of the techniques are demonstrated in a Java 3D software framework included with the book, which also provides developers with many general-purpose building blocks for constructing their own user interfaces.    Applications and their use of 3D are approached realistically. The book is geared towards sophisticated user interfaces for the \"everyday user\" who doesn't have a lot of time to learn another application--much less a complicated one--and an everyday computer system without exotic devices like head mounted displays and data gloves. Perhaps the best description of this book is: \"A roadmap from Java 3D to 'Swing 3D'.\"",

      "longDescription": "Hibernate practically exploded on the Java scene. Why is this open-source tool so popular  Because it automates a tedious task: persisting your Java objects to a relational database. The inevitable mismatch between your object-oriented code and the relational database requires you to write code that maps one to the other. This code is often complex, tedious and costly to develop. Hibernate does the mapping for you.    Not only that, Hibernate makes it easy. Positioned as a layer between your application and your database, Hibernate takes care of loading and saving of objects. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. And they perform better than anything you are likely to develop yourself.    Hibernate in Action carefully explains the concepts you need, then gets you going. It builds on a single example to show you how to use Hibernate in practice, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, how to efficiently retrieve objects and use caching.    The authors created Hibernate and they field questions from the Hibernate community every day - they know how to make Hibernate sing. Knowledge and insight seep out of every pore of this book.",

Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping so it's a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standards.    Java Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. You'll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques.

OpenLaszlo is an increasingly popular open-source platform for the development and delivery of rich internet applications across multiple platforms: Flash, DHTML, and J2ME. The dramatic emergence of Ajax over the past year was a first step in the transition from page-oriented HTML web applications towards more full-featured rich internet applications. OpenLaszlo provides another important step in this continuing evolutionary process through the increased productivity resulting from LZX's declarative approach. It provides developers with the tools to create web-based applications offering the usability and interactivity associated with desktop applications, and the low costs associated with web-based deployment. The cross-platform nature of Laszlo LZX applications allows source code with only minimum modifications to run natively on all popular web browsers, on all desktop operating systems, on the Flash platform, and other platforms in the future.    Written to address the needs of a wide spectrum of developers, ranging from client-side HTML and JavaScript developers all the way to enterprise-class Java or Rails engineers, this book provides a very hands-on approach towards building applications that solve real-world problems across both the Flash and DHTML platforms. Starting with the fundamentals of Laszlo LZX, the authors quickly move towards applying this knowledge to the design and development of a full-scale application called the Laszlo Market. This provides a working context to assist understanding the underlying concepts of Laszlo LZX and, more importantly, how to apply this knowledge in innovative ways. The construction of the Laszlo Market proceeds over the course of the book illustrating topics starting with an initial wireframe and storyboard design to optimization issues dealing with the application's deployment across the Flash and DHTML platforms.",

Only then do you write the code itself and, with the test spurring you on, improve your design. In acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), you use the same technique to implement product features, benefiting from iterative development, rapid feedback cycles, and better-defined requirements. TDD and its supporting tools and techniques lead to better software faster.    Test Driven brings under one cover practical TDD techniques distilled from several years of community experience. With examples in Java and the Java EE environment, it explores both the techniques and the mindset of TDD and ATDD. It uses carefully chosen examples to illustrate TDD tools and design patterns, not in the abstract but concretely in the context of the technologies you face at work. It is accessible to TDD beginners, and it offers effective and less-well-known techniques to older TDD hands.",

As NHibernate is a port of Hibernate from Java to .NET, the book is based on Manning's bestselling Hibernate in Action.    NHibernate in Action begins by describing how to implement persistence in a layered .NET application. The book then quickly springs into action by introducing NHibernate through a classic \"Hello World\" example. It explains how to configure NHibernate to specify the mapping information between business objects and database tables, and then explores the internal architecture of NHibernate. A complete example application is progressively built with Agile methodologies in mind, which shows readers all kinds of entity and relationship mappings and how to perform CRUD operations. The book also covers advanced techniques like caching, concurrency access, and isolation levels. The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and criteria query APIs are thoroughly detailed with optimization tips.    The last chapters of this book discuss various development scenarios, how to implement the layers of an NHibernate application (covering Windows and Web development), and which tools are available for these tasks. They also provide some solutions for data-binding objects to .NET GUI controls, integrating services, and interacting with components using DataSets. Finally, they explain how to build a complex application involving advanced session management and distributed transactions.",

      "longDescription": "A software system is the realization of a set of concerns. One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are provided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is divided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ. The second and third parts present examples of everyday situations in which you can use simple and easy AspectJ solutions to implement common system requirements such as logging, policy enforcement, resource pooling, business rules, thread-safety, authentication and authorization, as well as transaction management.",

      "longDescription": "Hadoop is an open source framework implementing the MapReduce algorithm behind Google's approach to querying the distributed data sets that constitute the internet. This definition naturally leads to an obvious question, \"What are \"maps\" and why do they need to be \"reduced \"    Massive data sets can be extremely difficult to analyze and query using traditional mechanisms, especially when the queries themselves are quite complicated. In effect, the MapReduce algorithm breaks up both the query and the data set into constituent parts   that's the \"mapping.\" The mapped components of the query can be processed simultaneously   or \"reduced\"   to rapidly return results.    Hadoop in Action teaches readers how to use Hadoop and write MapReduce programs. The intended readers are programmers, architects, and project managers who have to process large amounts of data offline. Hadoop in Action will lead the reader from obtaining a copy of Hadoop to setting it up in a cluster and writing data analytic programs.    The book begins by making the basic idea of Hadoop and MapReduce easier to grasp by applying the default Hadoop installation to a few easy-to-follow tasks, such as analyzing changes in word frequency across a body of documents. The book continues through the basic concepts of MapReduce applications developed using Hadoop, including a close look at framework components, use of Hadoop for a variety of data analysis tasks, and numerous examples of Hadoop in action.    Hadoop in Action will explain how to use Hadoop and present design patterns and practices of programming MapReduce. MapReduce is a complex idea both conceptually and in its implementation, and Hadoop users are challenged to learn all the knobs and levers for running Hadoop. This book takes you beyond the mechanics of running Hadoop, teaching you to write meaningful programs in a MapReduce framework.    This book assumes the reader will have a basic familiarity with Java, as most code examples will be written in Java. Familiarity with basic statistical concepts (e.g. histogram, correlation) will help the reader appreciate the more advanced data processing examples.",

      "longDescription": "Frameworks are object-oriented programming environments for vertical application areas. This book is the first to survey this exciting new technology, its concepts, and practical applications. Considered the next step in the evolution of OOP, framework technology is at the center stage of the software strategies of Taligent, IBM, HP, Microsoft, and Apple, among others. In spite of that, frameworks remain poorly understood, and are rarely covered in the literature. This book condenses practical experience and research ideas; explains exotic terminology so that a novice computer professional can quickly absorb it; is easy to read and conceptually crisp; and will be useful to many types of readers, from programmers to technical managers.    Object-Oriented Application Frameworks:  Covers real-world commercial and public-domain frameworks:  MacApp, ET++, Taligent's Frameworks, Unidraw, InterViews (precursor of Fresco), and Prograph  Illustrates how the technology is used in applications (e.g., MFC from Microsoft) and languages (e.g., Prograph from Prograph International)  Introduces and explains the ideas in plain English",

      "longDescription": "Many web development frustrations can be traced back to the underlying stateless HTTP protocol. Tapestry represents state and behavior as standard Java objects, methods and properties. That means state management and multithreading are handled by the framework, leaving you with just your application's business logic. Tapestry does more, you do less.    Tapestry in Action is the definitive guide to the Tapestry approach: creating full-featured web apps by connecting framework components to economical amounts of application code. Many simple examples show you how to tackle common tasks such as form validation, application localization, client-side scripting, and synchronization between browser and app server. Later chapters discuss more advanced topics including creation of new components and integration with J2EE.    If you want to create great web applications using Tapestry and know Java (plus plain-vanilla HTML and a little XML), this book is for you.",

JSF components (buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, data grids, etc.) live between user requests, which eliminates the hassle of maintaining state. JSF also synchronizes user input with application objects, automating another tedious aspect of web development.    JavaServer Faces in Action is an introduction, a tutorial, and a handy reference. With the help of many examples, the book explains what JSF is, how it works, and how it relates to other frameworks and technologies like Struts, Servlets, Portlets, JSP, and JSTL. It provides detailed coverage of standard components, renderers, converters, and validators, and how to use them to create solid applications. This book will help you start building JSF solutions today.",

      "longDescription": "LINQ, Language INtegrated Query, is a new extension to the Visual Basic and C# programming languages designed to simplify data queries and database interaction. It addreses O/R mapping issues by making query operations like SQL statements part of the programming language. Adding to its power, LINQ is extensible and can be used to query various data sources. It offers built-in support for querying in-memory collections like arrays or lists, XML, DataSets, and relational databases.    LINQ in Action is a fast-paced, comprehensive tutorial for professional developers who want to use LINQ. This book explores what can be done with LINQ, shows you how it works in an application, and addresses the emerging best practices. It presents the general purpose query facilities offered by LINQ in the upcoming C# 3.0 and VB.NET 9.0 languages. A running example introduces basic LINQ concepts. You   ll then learn to query unstructured data using LINQ to XML and relational data with LINQ to SQL. Finally, you   ll see how to extend LINQ for custom applications.    LINQ in Action will guide you along as you navigate this new world of lambda expressions, query operators, and expression trees. You   ll also explore the new features of C# 3.0, VB.NET 9.0. The book is very practical, anchoring each new idea with running code.    You will discover all the basics needed to get a clear understanding of LINQ. Whether you want to use LINQ to query objects, XML documents, or relational databases, you will find all the information you need to get started.    But LINQ in Action does not stop at the basic code. This book also shows you how LINQ can be used for advanced processing of data. This includes coverage of LINQ   s extensibility, which allows querying more data sources than those supported by default.    All code samples are built on a concrete business case. The running example, LinqBooks, is a personal book cataloging system that shows you how to create LINQ applications with Visual Studio 2008.",

Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.    Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.",

New technologies and devices   not to mention higher user expectations   have greatly multiplied the complexity level of interface programming. Enter JavaFX.    JavaFX is a set of Java-based rich user interface technologies that sits atop the existing Java Standard and Micro Editions, making current Java packages readily accessible from the JavaFX environment. At its heart is JavaFX Script, an innovative, compiled, domain specific language. JavaFX Script boasts a declarative syntax where the code structure mirrors the structure of the interface. Related UI pieces are kept in one efficient bundle, not strewn across multiple locations. A simple coding model reduces code complexity while increasing productivity. The JavaFX-specific libraries for presentation and animation take advantage of JavaFX Script's unique language features.    JavaFX in Action is a hands-on tutorial that introduces and explores JavaFX through numerous bite-sized projects. The book provides a solid grounding in the JavaFX syntax and related APIs by showing you how to apply the key features of the JavaFX platform. You'll absorb the fundamentals of the technology while exploring the possibilities JavaFX open up for your designs.    Author Simon Morris helps you transform variables and operators into bouncing raindrops, brilliant colors, and dancing interface components. Below the chrome, you'll master techniques to make your applications more responsive and user friendly. You'll also learn how to interact with your existing Java code so you can give your old apps some new JavaFX sparkle.",

And since it's built from the ground up as a core part of the .NET framework, it integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET features, such as Web Forms or Master Pages, that you already use.

      "longDescription": "Positioned as a layer between the application and the database, Hibernate is a powerful object/relational persistence and query service for Java. It takes care of automating a tedious task: the manual bridging of the gap between object oriented code and the relational database. Hibernate Quickly gives you all you need to start working with Hibernate now.    The book focuses on the 20% you need 80% of the time. The pages saved are used to introduce you to the Hibernate \"ecosystem\": how Hibernate can work with other common development tools and frameworks like XDoclet, Struts, Webwork, Spring, and Tapestry.    The book builds its code examples incrementally, introducing new concepts as it goes. It covers Hibernate's many, useful configuration and design options, breaking a complex subject into digestible pieces. With a gradual \"crawl-walk-run\" approach, the book teaches you what Hibernate is, what it can do, and how you can work with it effectively.",

Because they are often large and complex, GUI programming toolkits can be hard to use. wxPython is a combination of the Python programming language and the wxWidgets toolkit, which allows programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. wxPython combines the power of an exceptionally complete user interface toolkit with an exceptionally flexible programming language. The result is a toolkit that is unique in the ease with which complex applications can be built and maintained.    wxPython in Action is a complete guide to the wxPython toolkit, containing a tutorial for getting started, a guide to best practices, and a reference to wxPython s extensive widget set. After an easy introduction to wxPython concepts and programming practices, the book takes an in-depth tour of when and how to use the bountiful collection of widgets offered by wxPython. All features are illustrated with useful code examples and reference tables are included for handy lookup of an object s properties, methods, and events.

OOram has been fine-tuned over a decade on hundreds of projects by Trygve Reenskaug and his collaborators. It is supported by available CASE tools, training, and consulting.    Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them. These ideas form the heart of the OOram approach.    In a presentation rich with examples, Working With Objects is anything but the typical, dry methodology book. It tells real-life stories. It teaches how to apply role modeling and benefit from its inherent advantages, including:    Multiple views of the same model  Support for both data- and process-centered approaches  Large systems described through a number of distinct models  Derivation of composite models from simpler, base models  Decentralized management of very large systems  Programming language-independent design  Step-by-step transformation of models into implementations  Integration of powerful reuse techniques with work policies, processes and organization",

      "longDescription": "JavaScript developers commonly rely on collections of reusable JavaScript code--written by themselves or by someone else at their company. Alternatively, they rely on code from a third party. But in all these cases they need to know how to either construct a cross-browser library from scratch or be adept at using and maintaining their library of choice.    In Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, JavaScript expert John Resig reveals the inside know-how of the elite JavaScript programmers. Written to be accessible to JavaScript developers with intermediate-level skills, this book will give you the knowledge you need to create a cross-browser JavaScript library from the ground up.    This book takes you on a journey towards mastering modern JavaScript development in three phases: design, construction, and maintenance. You first are given a base of strong, advanced JavaScript knowledge, enabling you to make decisions about the overall design of a library and how to tackle its eventual construction. The book then teaches you how to construct your library. It examines all the numerous tasks JavaScript libraries have to tackle and provides practical solutions and development strategies for their creation. It then guides you through the various maintenance techniques you will need to keep your code running well into the future.    With Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja you will have all the knowledge and skills available to build your own JavaScript library, or to understand how to use any modern JavaScript library available.",

      "longDescription": "SOA   Service Oriented Architecture   has become the leading solution for complex, connected business systems. While it's easy to grasp the theory of SOA, implementing well-designed, practical SOA systems can be a difficult challenge. Developers and enterprise architects still face the following issues:        * How to get high-availability with SOA      * How to know a service has failed      * How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services      * How to increase the loose coupling of your SOA      * How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers--internal and external      * How to integrate SOA and the UI      * How to avoid common SOA pitfalls      * How to choose technologies that increase the performance of your services    In SOA Patterns, author Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others. This book provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic Problem/Solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.    SOA Patterns shows you how to address common SOA concerns, including the areas of performance, availability, scalability, security, management, service interaction, user interface interaction, and service aggregation. The SOA anti-patterns part shows you how to avoid common mistakes and how to refactor broken systems. The book also maps quality attributes to patterns so that you can easily find the patterns relevant to your problems.    WHAT'S INSIDE:        * Details more than 30 patterns for common SOA scenarios in the areas of security, performace, availability, UI integration, service aggregation and service interaction      * Describes more than 20 SOA pitfalls to avoid      * Spotlights the architecural perspective on SOA      * Explains technology mapping from conceptual solution to current technologies      * Provides extensive and practical advice on matching patterns to technologies  ",

Applied well, it enables programmers to successfully deal with complexity in software and add new features to existing apps with greater ease. DI is the key to writing modular software and producing flexible and maintainable code bases.    While well-known among Java developers and other practitioners of object-oriented design, DI is only now gaining momentum in the .NET community. The Unity container released by Microsoft patterns & practices and the new Microsoft Extensibility Framework (MEF) make DI more relevant than ever for .NET developers.    Dependency Injection in .NET is a comprehensive guide than introduces DI and provides an in-depth look at applying DI practices to .NET apps. In it, you will also learn to integrate DI together with such technologies as Windows Communication Foundation, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation and other core .NET components.    Building on your existing knowledge of C# and the .NET platform, this book will be most beneficial for readers who have already built at least a few software solutions of intermediate complexity. Most examples are in plain C# without use of any particular DI framework. Later, the book introduces several well-known DI frameworks, such as StructureMap, Windsor and Spring.NET.

If you prefer not to do the writing yourself, then Java Applets and Channels Without Programming is for you. It collects almost 100 applets on a CD with detailed instructions on how to use each applet. In addition, style issues are discussed in detail; not only will you learn how to use each applet, you will learn when and where it is appropriate to use each applet. The book also introduces the new concept of channels and shows how these can be used on your web site as well.    The CD-ROM also contains an exclusive applet configuration utility, a program that allows you to configure the Java applets on the CD-ROM in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) environment. When using the utility to configure Java applets, you do not need to know any Java programming or even any HTML programming. All you do is change the value of a parameter and click on a button to see the resulting change to the applet. The applet configuration utility is written in Java and runs in your browser, so it runs on any computer platform for which there is a Java-enabled browser.    The CD-ROM also provides example web pages for more than 60 of the included applets, so you can learn how to use the applets in real-world situations.",

Eric Siber, Developpez.com",
      "longDescription": "Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the middle of a rigid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.",

The book lays out the core of ActiveMQ in clear language, starting with the anatomy of a JMS message and moving quickly through connectors, message persistence, authentication and authorization. With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You'll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you'll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You'll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.

This book provides techniques for solving real-world problems such as testing AJAX applications, using mocks to achieve testing isolation, in-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and test automation.",
      "longDescription": "When JUnit was first introduced a decade ago by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma, the Agile movement was in its infancy, \"Test Driven Development\" was unknown, and unit testing was just starting to move into the typical developer's vocabulary. Today, most developers acknowledge the benefits of unit testing and rely on the increasingly sophisticated tools now available. The recently released JUnit 4.5 represents the state of the art in unit testing frameworks, and provides significant new features to improve the Java development process.    JUnit in Action, Second Edition is an up-to-date guide to unit testing Java applications (including Java EE applications) using the JUnit framework and its extensions. This book provides techniques for solving real-world problems such as testing AJAX applications, using mocks to achieve testing isolation, in-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and test automation.    Written to help readers exploit JUnit 4.5, the book covers recent innovations such as the new annotations that simplify test writing, improved exception handling, and the new assertion methods. You'll also discover how to use JUnit extensions to test new application styles and frameworks including Ajax, OSGi, and HTML-based presentation layers.    Using a sample-driven approach, various unit testing strategies are covered, such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, and web applications. Also addressed are testing strategies using freely available open source frameworks and tools, and how to unit test in isolation with Mock Objects. The book will also bring you up to speed on the latest thinking in TDD, BDD, Continuous Integration, and other practices related to unit testing.  ",

Reusing design patterns is not enough for success: patterns are like partial maps of dangerous terrain. They help, but don't prevent you from getting lost. Bitter Java teaches you how to recognize when you are lost, and how to get back on the right path. It illustrates common pitfalls of Java programming through code examples; it then refactors the code and explains why the new solutions are safe.    This book is a systematic account of common server-side Java programming mistakes, their causes and solutions. It covers antipatterns for base Java and J2EE concepts such as Servlets, JSPs, EJBs, enterprise connection models, and scalability.

EJB is experiencing the mixture of practical success and controversy that accompanies a new and quickly-changing framework. Bitter EJB takes the swirling EJB controversies head-on. It offers a practical approach to design: how to become a better programmer by studying problems and solutions to the most important problems surrounding the technology.    The flip side of design patterns, antipatterns, are a fun and interesting way to take EJB expertise to the next level. The book covers many different aspects of EJB, from transactions to persistence to messaging, as well as performance and testing.    Bitter EJB will teach programmers to do the following:    Identify EJB persistence strategies  Choose Entity bean alternatives  Use EJB message driven beans  Know when to apply or avoid stateful session beans  Create efficient build strategies with XDoclet, Ant and JUnit  Automate performance tuning",

Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That's where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You're never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don't have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you'll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you're new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you're building. You'll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you'll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE.

      "longDescription": "It seems like we're all being asked to multi-task more than ever   and our computers are no exception to this trend. Multiple processors with multiple cores running multiple threads is quickly becoming the norm. C++ developers will have to master the principles, techniques, and new language features supporting concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.    With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. There is a new memory model with support for multiple threads, along with a new multi-threading support library featuring low-level atomic operations, as well as basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.    C++ Concurrency in Action is the first book to show you how to take advantage of the new C++ Standard and TR2 to write robust multi-threaded applications in C++.    As a guide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multi-threaded code before.    If you're a programmer accustomed to writing single-threaded applications, C++ Concurrency in Action will show you how to write your new parallel algorithm in C++. You'll learn to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with writing multi-threaded applications. You can also use this book to quickly transfer your platform-specific knowledge to the new Standard C++ threading library, enabling you to use a single API on both systems and simplify your code.",

A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to consider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions. However, the book is detailed enough that it may also serve as a reference for the developer.",

It lives up to the name HTML5 in Action by giving you the practical, hands-on guidance you'll need to use key features like:\n\n    * The new semantic elements and form input types\n    * Native multimedia playback with the video and audio elements\n    * Canvas and 2D drawing APIs\n    * Offline applications\n    * Local and session storage, IndexedDB databases\n    * Web workers\n    * Geolocation, File API, History API\n    * Cross-document Message API\n    * Much, much more\n\nWith this book, you can confidently start using HTML5 today. The relevant, easy-to-follow examples will make you a HTML5 master in no time. You'll even learn how to provide fallbacks for browsers that don't support particular HTML5 features.",

ASP.NET MVC is a development framework designed around these principles. It provides the structure you need to follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, in which an application is divided into three distinct parts:        * Models, the objects that contain an application's logic      * Views, the components that create the user interface of an application      * Controllers, the components that handle and respond to user input    Applications built with ASP.NET MVC are easier to test, maintain, and extend because the architecture and role of each component is well-defined. And since it's built from the ground up as a core part of the .NET framework, it integrates seamlessly with the ASP.NET features, such as Web Forms or Master Pages, that you already use.

      "longDescription": "Open source tools provide a powerful and flexible environment for web development and maintenance. If your site has complex business rules or server logic, then you need more than just an interface builder. You need a strong application language with effective tools ready at hand. Perl's strengths make it a natural choice.    Did you know you can easily build a site with features like message forums, chat, session management, custom preferences and other features your users will love  This book shows you how. But it is more than a programming book. It covers a wide spectrum of practical issues and how to handle them, such as when to use a database, what information needs to be secure (and how to secure it), and how to keep traffic from crippling your site. It will teach you the empowering use of ready-made modules so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. And it will even teach you how to successfully advocate the use of Open Source tools in your company.",

      "longDescription": "It's been said that data is the new \"dirt\"   the raw material from which and on which you build the structures of the modern world. And like dirt, data can seem like a limitless, undifferentiated mass. The ability to take raw data, access it, filter it, process it, visualize it, understand it, and communicate it to others is possibly the most essential business problem for the coming decades.    \"Machine learning,\" the process of automating tasks once considered the domain of highly-trained analysts and mathematicians, is the key to efficiently extracting useful information from this sea of raw data. By implementing the core algorithms of statistical data processing, data analysis, and data visualization as reusable computer code, you can scale your capacity for data analysis well beyond the capabilities of individual knowledge workers.    Machine Learning in Action is a unique book that blends the foundational theories of machine learning with the practical realities of building tools for everyday data analysis. In it, you'll use the flexible Python programming language to build programs that implement algorithms for data classification, forecasting, recommendations, and higher-level features like summarization and simplification.    As you work through the numerous examples, you'll explore key topics like classification, numeric prediction, and clustering. Along the way, you'll be introduced to important established algorithms, such as Apriori, through which you identify association patterns in large datasets and Adaboost, a meta-algorithm that can increase the efficiency of many machine learning tasks.",

      "longDescription": "In object-oriented programming, a central program normally controls other objects in a module, library, or framework. With dependency injection, this pattern is inverted   a reference to a service is placed directly into the object which eases testing and modularity. Spring or Google Guice use dependency injection so you can focus on your core application and let the framework handle infrastructural concerns.    Dependency Injection explores the DI idiom in fine detail, with numerous practical examples that show you the payoffs. You'll apply key techniques in Spring and Guice and learn important pitfalls, corner-cases, and design patterns. Readers need a working knowledge of Java but no prior experience with DI is assumed.",
